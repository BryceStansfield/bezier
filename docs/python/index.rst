Python Package
==============

Documentation for the ``bezier`` Python :doc:`package <reference/bezier>` is
provided here. In addition to the Python package, :doc:`pxd/index` are
provided for downstream packages which seek to use ``libbezier`` from Cython
in the same way the ``bezier`` package does.

For more information on how the :doc:`binary-extension` is built, a
document is provided with explanations on the headers, compilation process,
build relocatable wheels and other topics.
