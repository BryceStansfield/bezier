## Release Logs

The `release-logs` branch in the `bezier` project is a hacky way to preserve
CI logs for historical releases. It was motivated (February 24, 2021) by the
retention policy of GitHub Actions, which will only keep builds around for
a maximum of 90 days. For historical releases on CircleCI, AppVeyor and
Travis CI this had not been a problem.
