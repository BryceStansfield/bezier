Development
===========

Here are some pointers for hacking on ``bezier``.

Adding Features
---------------

In order to add a feature to ``bezier``:

1. **File an issue** to discuss the change

1. **Add tests**: The feature must work fully on the following
   CPython versions: 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 on both UNIX and Windows.
   In addition, the feature should have 100% line coverage.

1. The feature must (should) be documented with helpful ``doctest``
   examples wherever relevant.
