"""Helper for implicitizing B |eacute| zier curves.

.. _Farouki and Rajan: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-8396(88)90016-7

Primarily uses the `resultant`_ to evaluate the implicitized
`algebraic curve`_. In order to do this on B |eacute| zier curves
without translating to a power basis, we utilize the work of
`Farouki and Rajan`_ to compute a modified Sylvester determinant.

def evaluate(nodes, x, y):
    r"""Evaluate the implicitized bivariate polynomial containing the curve.

    Assumes `algebraic curve`_ containing :math:`B(s, t)` is given by
    :math:`f(x, y) = 0`. This function evaluates :math:`f(x, y)`.

    .. note::

       This assumes, but doesn't check, that ``nodes`` has 2 columns.

    .. note::

       This assumes, but doesn't check, that ``nodes`` is not degree-elevated.
       If it were degree elevated, then the Sylvester matrix will always
       have zero determinant.

    Args:
        nodes (numpy.ndarray): ``Nx2`` array of nodes in a curve.
        x (float): ``x``-coordinate for evaluation.
        y (float): ``y``-coordinate for evaluation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the curve is a point.
        NotImplementedError: If the curve is not degree 1.
